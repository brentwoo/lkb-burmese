Corpus sentence
===============

အကြိမ်ကြိမ်ဖတ်ပြီး အထပ်ထပ် အခါခါ စဉ်းစားပါတယ်။
akjeinkjein hpa pji ahtahta akhakha sinza pa te
frequently read AUX again repeatedly consider POLITE RLS 
`I read them numerous times, and pondered on them over and over.'

I omitted the optional POLITE particle to avoid needless proliferation of honorific generation alternatives, but in retrospect I suppose VPM could cull those variants.

so my actual test string was

akjeinkjein hpa pji ahtahta akhakha sinza te
frequently read AUX again repeatedly consider RLS 
`I read them numerous times, and pondered on them over and over.'

Consulted the oracle customization system for a VP-coordination rule:

(burmese.tdl)

vp5-top-coord-rule := basic-vp-top-coord-rule & apoly-top-coord-rule &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.COORD-STRAT "5" ].

vp5-bottom-coord-rule := unary-bottom-coord-rule & vp-bottom-coord-phrase &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ COORD-STRAT "5",
                   COORD-REL.PRED "_and_coord_rel" ] ].

(rules.tdl)

vp5-top-coord := vp5-top-coord-rule.

vp5-bottom-coord := vp5-bottom-coord-rule.

Added all words in the lexicon, including the reduplicative adverbs as single lex items:

ahtahta := adverb-lex &
  [ STEM < "ahtahta" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_again_adv_rel" ].


VPM
===

I believe the only changes I had to make in semi.vpm were regularizing PERNUM according to the ENG grammar:

PNG.PER : PERS
  1st <> first
  2nd <> second
  3rd <> third
  * <> !

PNG.NUM : NUM
  singular <> sg
  sg <> *
  sg << pl
  plural <> pl
  * <> !

I intended to neutralize the 'generic plural' from the English sentences into singular, because while Burmese does have sg pl distinction with a suffix, the pl is not used for generic sentences like these ones.


Changes and test sentence for MT
================================

I included a tsdb profile with all the test MT sentences in Burmese for reference, it's called "mmt sentences".

I tested translating

eng: dogs sleep

mya: khwei ei te
dog sleep RLS

Which works. But ENG->MYA usually generates alternatives with optional case markers (ka = SUBJ, kou = OBJ).

The other MT sentences that successfully translate are:

Dogs sleep.
Dogs chase cars.
*I chase you. [these and the others with pronouns I didn't fix pron_rel in ENG, but I imagine that they work; the tsdb profile can verify that the sentences parse and generate MYA-internally]
These dogs sleep.
Dogs eat.
*I can eat glass.
*It doesnt hurt me.
The dogs chase cars.
*I think that you know that dogs chase cars.
*I ask whether you know that dogs chase cars. 
Cats and dogs chase cars.
*Dogs chase cars and cats chase dogs. [no S coord yet]
Cats chase dogs and sleep.
Do cats chase dogs?
Hungry dogs eat.
*Dogs eat quickly. [no MYA pred quickly yet]
The dogs are hungry.
The dogs are in the park.
The dogs are the cats.


Fixes, some of which were related to MT task
============================================

to rule out sentences like

Judgment: u
di ngapyothi apya te
this banana blue.ATTRIB RLS
`This blue banana.'

from parsing, added an #opt tag to have AUX copy the OPT value of its complement VP's SUBJ.

arg-comp-aux := aux-lex & basic-two-arg &
  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT.VAL [ ...
                             COMPS < #comps ..... >,
                             SUBJ < #subj > ] ... ] ],
    ARG-ST < #subj &
             [ OPT #opt...],
             #comps &
             [ LOCAL [ CAT [ VAL [ SUBJ < [ OPT #opt ... ] > ] ] ] ] > ].

---------

Fixing case-marked noun phrases, like

ceno ka hpan kou ma sa hpu
I SUB glass OBJ NEG eat RLS
`I don't eat glass.'

The arg-comp auxes, like "ma" (NEG) were not letting case-marked noun phrases through, which look like PPs. So generalized the type to take SUBJs that are adp- or noun-headed, +np:

arg-comp-aux := aux-lex & basic-two-arg &
  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT.VAL [ ...
                             SUBJ < #subj > ]... ],
    ARG-ST < #subj &
             [ ...
               LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD +np ...

Also removed ARG-ST < [] , [LIGHT - ... ] > restriction because these auxes appeared to conflict with HC-LIGHT on some verbs. But come to think of it now I'm not sure why some verbs are not LIGHT. I think that was a leftover problem.

arg-comp-aux-no-pred := arg-comp-aux & raise-sem-lex-item &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.POL #polarity,
    ARG-ST < [ ],
             [ 
	       LOCAL.CAT

--------------
I discovered that on generation/translation I would get sentence final particles and other auxes in the middle of the sentence! So it would generate sentences like the second:

ceno ei te
I sleep RLS

* ceno te ei
I RLS sleep
`I sleep.'

Fixed INIT values on various types to properly conflict and rule out. So for example, the sentence final particles should only appear sentence-finally... and not strangely in the middle of the sentence.

head-comp-phrase := ...
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD [ INIT + ]

arg-comp-aux-no-pred := ...
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.INIT - ]

----------------

Split arg-comp-aux-no-pred into two subtypes, one for SFP and one for others. The purpose of this was a sort of flag, only after a SFP attaches then the sentence is finite and licenses an S, to prevent generating inadvertent premature sentences with, say, negation (another no-pred aux), but not a SFP.

sentence-final-particle := arg-comp-aux-no-pred &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM finite ].

non-sentence-final-particle := arg-comp-aux-no-pred &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.FORM nonfinite ].



TSDB Coverage
=============

Analyze | Coverage

	Total	Positive	Distinct Anyzes	Total Results	Overall Coverage
Total	176	110		5.21		61		55.5

Analyze | Overgeneration

	Total	Negative	Distinct	Total Results	Overall
Total	176	66		7.08		12		18.2

Compare | Competence, between lab8 and lab7

	lex	analyz	in	out	lex	analyz	in	out
total	0.88	3.04	19.1	9.1	0.86	5.52	55.5	18.2

Massive increase in coverage, likely due to fixing auxes and SFP for real. Also a small amount of overgeneration, which may be due to allowing VP-coordination? There are still 11 sentences wellformed/unanalyzed, several of these are ADJ-as-predicate sentences that just don't have lexical entries, one is an imperative, and one is the locative PP-as-predicate without a copula verb.

Just a note, this was by far the most satisfying lab so far, to see everything come together. The ENG->MYA translation was a great motivation to fix overgeneration.
